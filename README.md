# Stratum
A boilerplate Visual Studio solution for Sitecore projects.

The initial setting up of a Sitecore project can be a time-consuming task, especially when you have to create from scratch every time. But what if you could save yourself some valuable time and effort by using a module, that sets up the most typically used projects and code for you?

Introducing <b>Stratum</b>, a boilerplate Visual Studio solution for your Sitecore projects. In just a few steps, you can generate a basic but functional Sitecore website. The projects which are organized according to the Helix principles, have some commonly used functionality that you need to get started quickly and easily.

But that's not all. This module also includes serialized items for a demo page that showcases the code included in the solution. This could be a useful starting point for your own development, allowing you to focus on customizing and refining the code rather than building everything from scratch.

I have tested this module with <i>Sitecore 10.3</i>, but it might work with other versions also.

The following sections explain its key features, and might help you streamline your Sitecore development process. So, let's get started!

## Prerequisites
1. Visual Studio 2019+
2. A Sitecore instance (Optional if you don't want to view the demo page). 
3. PowerShell Extensions installed in your instance.
